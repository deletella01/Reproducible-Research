Severe weather events has been a constant cause of deterioration in public health of communities. 
It has also caused economic impediment across the United States. In this project, 
I explore the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s (NOAA) storm database. 
This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States,
including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, crop damage, 
and property damage. The events in the database start in the year 1950 and end in November 2011. 
I used the recorded observations to show the effects of severe weather on public health as well as its effect on the economy.
